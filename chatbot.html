            "What is your highest qualification?": "Your highest qualification should be mentioned in the education section of your resume. If you have multiple degrees, list the most relevant one first.",
            "What field are you looking to work in?": "Each industry has specific resume requirements. For example, tech resumes should highlight skills and projects, while marketing resumes should emphasize creativity and achievements.",
            "Do you have any previous work experience?": "If you do, list your experiences in reverse chronological order, focusing on key achievements rather than just responsibilities.",
            "What are your top skills?": "Soft skills like communication and leadership are valuable, but technical skills specific to your job role are essential for ATS compatibility.",
            "Are you looking for an internship or a full-time job?": "Internships should focus on academic achievements and projects, while full-time job resumes should emphasize work experience and career progression.",
            "Would you like resume formatting tips?": "Use a clean, professional format with clear headings. Avoid fancy fonts and excessive design elements as they may confuse ATS systems.",
            "Do you need help optimizing your resume for ATS?": "Use industry-specific keywords from the job description and ensure your resume is saved in an ATS-friendly format like .docx or .pdf.",
            "How many years of experience do you have?": "Tailor your resume based on experience. If you have 5+ years, focus on leadership roles. If less, highlight skills and projects.",
            "Would you like tips on writing a strong summary statement?": "A resume summary should be 2-3 sentences long and highlight your top skills, experience, and career goals.",
            "Do you want to know about keywords that can improve your resume?": "Yes! Always extract keywords from the job posting and incorporate them naturally into your resume.",
            "Have you ever used a professional resume writer or career coach?": "They can be helpful if you're struggling to showcase your strengths effectively.",
            "Would you like guidance on writing a compelling cover letter?": "Your cover letter should be personalized for each job, mentioning how your skills align with the company's needs.",
            "How do you typically approach job applications?": "Job boards, referrals, and networking on LinkedIn are effective ways to land interviews.",
            "Do you need help tailoring your resume for different job applications?": "Always customize your resume for each job by highlighting the most relevant skills and experiences.",
            "Would you like strategies for networking and improving your LinkedIn profile?": "Ensure your LinkedIn matches your resume, join industry groups, and engage with professional content.",
            "Have you encountered difficulties getting interview calls despite having experience?": "This may be due to an ATS-unfriendly resume. Try tweaking your format and adding more relevant keywords.",
            "Do you need help preparing for behavioral or technical interview questions?": "Yes! Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for behavioral answers, and practice coding/technical questions for industry roles.",
            "Would you like guidance on salary negotiation techniques?": "Research industry standards and confidently state your expected salary based on experience and skills.",
            "What career goals do you have for the next five years?": "Having a clear career goal helps shape your resume and job search strategy. Consider where you want to be and what skills you need to get there."
